# Juke-o-Matic

A coin operated PC based Jukebox written in VB6. I created this a long time ago and had it operating in a pub on top of Windows 95 for a fair while. This will require some work to get going as the coin slot/free play/up/down/select and back buttons were connected to a 15pin joystick that were common many years ago. The comms to joystick port was via a sharewhare OCX called JKjoystick. Seeing that this file is hard to come by now and the joystick port no longer exists on modern PC's you may need to find an alternate solution to tackle this. I have no time to bring this program up to current standards so please fork this and see what you can do.
